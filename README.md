# sBTC Bridge Service

Indexes and caches contract data to make the api client application faster
and more flexible.

## Development

To run the server in watch mode (nodemon) for rapid development;

```bash
cd sbtc-bridge-api
node -v
v19.7.0
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note: the dev script concurrently builds the [swagger docs](http://localhost:3010/docs) for
the application.
